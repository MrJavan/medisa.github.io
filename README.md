This system is a helpful tool for medical staff and serves as a replacement for recording patient information on paper. Instead of writing down patient details manually, the doctor enters the information into the Medisa app, where itâ€™s stored in a database and can be accessed by other healthcare team members. Additionally, the system uses artificial intelligence to assist in the quick diagnosis of diseases.
